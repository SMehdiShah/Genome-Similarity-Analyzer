# **Genome Sequence Similarity Analysis**
## Overview
This project analyzes a given genome sequence and compares its substrings to a reference gene to determine their similarity percentage. It provides insights into how closely a section of the genome matches a target gene, which can be useful in genomic research and bioinformatics applications.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this script is to:

1. Compare subsequences of a genome with a reference gene.
2. Compute the similarity percentage between each substring and the reference gene.
3. Display the results for genomic analysis.

## How It Works
1. Define the Genome and Reference Gene

- A DNA sequence (genome) and a reference gene are provided as input.
2. Calculate the Length of the Reference Gene

- The script determines the number of characters in the reference gene to extract substrings of the same length from the genome.
3. Iterate Over Substrings

- The script extracts all possible substrings from the genome that match the length of the reference gene.
4. Compare Each Substring with the Reference Gene

- Each character of the substring is compared with the corresponding character in the reference gene.
- A match count is maintained.
5. Compute Similarity Percentage

- The number of matching characters is converted into a percentage to show how similar the substring is to the reference gene.
6. Display Results

- The similarity percentage is printed for each substring.
- A signature message is displayed at the end.

# **Installation & Usage**
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Any text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook)

## Applications
- Bioinformatics Research: Helps in DNA sequence analysis.
- Genetic Matching: Can be used to find conserved gene regions.
- Comparative Genomics: Identifies similar sequences in different species.

## Future Improvements
- Extend support for RNA sequences.
- Implement a GUI-based visualization.
- Optimize performance for large genomes.
